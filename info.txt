Battleship.

This game is still a demo under development within the scope of the subject LAB 2nd Semester 2020/2021.


You currently have 4 submarines that occupy only one space in the board each. 
After placing the boats, each player has 3 shots.
 When you hit you have two options "A" when you miss and "T" when you hit the target.


Made by Jose Rocha and Leonardo Botelho.
Have fun!
